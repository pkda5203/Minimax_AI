The Eval function of the non terminal nodes are calculated as follows:

	 eval function is calculated as following;
        
(4-in-rows of min^4 + 3-in-rows of min^3 + 2-in-rows of min^2) -(4-in-rows of max^4 + 3-in-rows of max^3 + 2-in-rows of max^2)

Explanation: the 4-in-rows are raised to the power of 4, similarly, 3-in-rows are raised to the power of 3 and 2-in-rows are raised to the power of 2 and are added together. It is  subtracted from the eval of the min player
